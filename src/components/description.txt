#Task manager built with useState () hook, then later 
#refactored using useReducer() hook for better state management.

--For useReducer () hook build, we included the following:
#All input details are saved inside local storage
#We built our own Alert component which is used for custom notification
#We built a custom confirm Modal(dialog box) also to edit and delete tasks.
